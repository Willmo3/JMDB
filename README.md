# JMDB

## About
### Contributors
This was a group project in my software engineering class. This is NOT exclusively my work. In particular:

 - Matthew Potter contributed immensely to the design and implementation of this software.
 - Professor Phil Riley oversaw our work and provided invaluable guidance.

### Explanation
JMDB (short for JMU IMDB) is a Java Swing application that allows users to query an IMDB database for information about movies, displaying that information in an accessible way.

## Usage
Unfortunately, because the API key has expired, searching movies no longer works. No results will be given!

However, if you want to poke around:

 1. Pull this repo.
 2. Within an IDE, run the `driver` file. It has been tested on Eclipse and Intellij.

### Why use an IDE?
This project was an internal prototype, and the focus was on learning software development best practices. Therefore, no packaged `jar` file exists to run it. Running this project from the terminal results in a bevy of compilation errors related to packaging.
